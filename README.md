# Image-Classification-using-CNN-for-Imagenette-Imagewoof-detaset
In this project we tried to classify two data set by Cpnvolution Newral Network (CNN) using Keras &amp; tenser flow: 
10 class problem, two different data sets, to be found at https:// github.com/fastai/imagenette
Imagenette : 10 classes, fairly simple to be separated from the 1000 class imagenet challenge
Imagewoof : 10 classes from imagenet depicting different dog breeds
Datasets contain separate training (train) and validation ( val ) folders
Programming Language: Python with TensorFlow, CNN and Keras etc.
Feature Extraction Techniques: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with maxpooling and Batch normalization layers on sequential model using keras and Tensorflow python libraries.
Classification Method: ANN and Dropout layers with sequential model using keras and Tensorflow python libraries.
We compared the results from each feature extraction and classification techniques to evaluate the model on the basis of overall Computation time and accuracy and finally achieved an accuracy of 46%
